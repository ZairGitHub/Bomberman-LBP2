# Bomberman LBP2
Repository designed to showcase Bomberman LBP2, a personal project undertaken in my own free time where I took it upon myself to explore the design philosophy of the Bomberman series and to learn about the practices of independent game development. The game is finished and fully functional, yet several planned features have been forcibly omitted as the game engine suffers from serious memory constraint issues.


## Getting Started
A [Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) video game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) and a copy of [Media Molecule's LittleBigPlanet 2 (LBP2) video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet_2) are required to play the game. First-time LBP2 users will need to progress through the first world of the **Story** section to unlock the required **Community** section. From the **Community** section, select **Text Search** and either search for **Bomberman LBP2** (the level title) or **XZairX** (the PlayStation Network ID of myself, the level author). The former will return a large set results relating to user-generated Bomberman levels whereas the latter will only return levels published by the author that was searched against. Simply navigate through the results until the Bomberman LBP2 level is located, select it, and the game will start.


### Prerequisites
* Sony PlayStation 3 video game console
* LittleBigPlanet 2 video game


## Level Showcase
The following sections will detail the design and mechanisms of the screens that the player can encounter when playing the game. These sections have been included to demonstrate the product to those who cannot meet the hardware prerequisites required to experience it first-hand.


### Video Demonstration

### TITLE Menu
This is the first thing the player sees upon entering the game. In the LittleBigPlanet series of games, players have the ability to customise the appearance of their avatars. The menu initially displays 4 default "naked" avatars in a sleeping state, but these will awake and be replaced by the custom avatars of players whose profiles are loaded into the game. Active avatars are backlit by a predetermined colour which corresponds to their player colour used during the main gameplay section of the game.

The menu is populated with a "TITLE" header, a level title header, and the option to either jump to the the SETTINGS menu or the CONTROLS menu by using the displayed button prompt. All menus can only be controlled by the player loaded in as the left-most avatar, a position which is assigned to the first loaded profile.
