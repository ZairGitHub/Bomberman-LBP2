# Bomberman LBP2
Repository designed to showcase Bomberman LBP2, a personal project undertaken in my own free time where I took it upon myself to explore the design philosophy of the Bomberman series and to learn about the practices of independent game development. The game is finished and fully functional, yet several planned features have been forcibly omitted as the game engine suffers from serious memory constraint issues.


## Getting Started
A [Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) video game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) and a copy of [Media Molecule's LittleBigPlanet 2 (LBP2) video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet_2) are required to play the game. First-time LBP2 users will need to progress through the first world of the **Story** section to unlock the required **Community** section. From the **Community** section, select **Text Search** and either search for **Bomberman LBP2** (the level title) or **XZairX** (the PlayStation Network ID of myself, the level author). The former will return a large set results relating to user-generated Bomberman levels whereas the latter will only return levels published by the author that was searched against. Simply navigate through the results until the Bomberman LBP2 level is located, select it, and the game will start.


### Prerequisites
* Sony PlayStation 3 video game console
* LittleBigPlanet 2 video game


## Level Showcase
The following sections will detail the design and mechanisms of the screens that the player can encounter when playing the game. These sections have been included to demonstrate the product to those who cannot meet the hardware prerequisites required to experience it first-hand.

### TITLE Menu
This is the first thing the player sees upon entering the game. In the LittleBigPlanet series of games, players have the ability to customise the appearance of their avatars. The menu initially displays 4 default "naked" avatars in a sleeping state, but these will awake and be replaced by the custom avatars of players whose profiles are loaded into the game. Active avatars are backlit by a predetermined colour which corresponds to their player colour: an identifer which is later used during the main gameplay section of the game.

The menu is populated with a "TITLE" header, a level title header, and the option to either jump to the the SETTINGS menu or the CONTROLS menu by using the displayed button prompt. All menus can only be controlled by the player loaded in as the left-most avatar, a position which is assigned to the first loaded profile of the game.

### CONTROLS Menu
A simple menu which displays a visual interface for the game's button map. As the player progresses through these menus, the positioning of the menu title header will shift either right or left to signify a forward or backward movement in menu progression. This menu previously featured more button inputs which were mapped to dropping specific special bombs, but these have since been compressed into one input after user complaints of being overwhelmed by the many commands.

### INSTRUCTIONS Menu
This menu holds the bulk of information which informs the player of the functionality of various objects encountered during gameplay. The L1 and R1 buttons are used to toggle left and right between the objects presented. These descriptions were initially very elaborate and detailed averaging at 4 lines each but have since been simplified to 2 lines maximum. This change is a result of analysing player behaviours during beta testing where it was determined that players were helpless during gameplay as the presented information was too profuse to be absorbed.

### SETTINGS Menu
This menu holds a variety of customisation options to encourage replayability. To be consistent with the control scheme of the other menus (particularly INFORMATION), L1 and R1 can be used to toggle left and right between the options of the settings. The Left Stick Up and Left Stick Down commands can also be used to toggle up and down between the different settings themselves. The button mapping for this functionality is not displayed as it is a natural instinct for users of the LBP2 community.

The leftmost column represents a setting's default value whereas the rightmost column is its maximum. All of these settings are self-explanatory save for CAMERA which increasingly reduces the number of viewable objects during gameplay to optimise the running performance of the game.

### TITLE Menu (Revisited)
// PLAY

In its initial stages of development, the player could freely select all of the menu options the moment they entered the level, including the ability to initiate the main gameplay. Though more practical, this design approach was scrapped as users would haphazardly jump into the game without.
